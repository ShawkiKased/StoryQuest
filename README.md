# Welcome To StoryQuest!

## Background and Overview

My Project will be a unqiue mix of a game and a demo showcase. StoryQuest will be an interractive Story Text Based game. You will be told a story with your Main Character through various and interractive Message Boxes. These will give you a scenario and options on how to proceed, maybe you'll be a in forest, or a cave or fighting enemies. The choice will effect the outcome and all the while the background will be a map telling you where your path has lead you.

## Functionality and MVP's

* Adventure through a map of locations
* Get into unique scenario's depending on their status

## Architecture and Technology

* Need to have a clean map that can properly visualize where the player is
* Need Boxes for Text and Scenario's to appear that the player can interract with
* Need to do this with just Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5, maybe even with Canvas.
* Need to read up on JavaScript functions that can help meld these things together properly

## Implementation TimeLine

* Spend day 1 properly visualizing how to get the correct technology and how the project will be structured, as well as making sure my project setup is working to begin with.
* WIP
