# Welcome To StoryQuest!

StoryQuest is an interractive Text Based Adventure. You will be told a story with your Main Character through various and interractive message boxes. These will give you a scenario and options on how to proceed, maybe you'll be a in forest, or a cave etc. You can visit it [Here!](https://shawkikased.github.io/StoryQuest/)

* Technologies used:
I used a simple combination of Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


## How it Works

Players will have to adventure through a puzzle based adventure, finding out their way through the various areas by listening to dialogue, and using items wisely through the various prompts.


## Specific Features


<!-- ## Functionality and MVP's

In StoryQuest, the User will be able to:
* Go through an Entire Adventure built through text box choices!
* Carry items which are represented by setting the state of objects, which will be needed to proceed in the game.
* A Background visual of your location to give you a sense of where you are.
* Save states so when the user refreshes, they will be to continue where they left off.

## Architecture and Technology

* DOM Manipulation will be used to render a selection box that will be where the main game is played.
* The Story and progression will be contained in an array of plot points labeled by ID's.
* Mostly click based, using onclick functions/event listeners.

## Game Structure Logic
* Player starts on the base area. Gets to choose where on the map to go.
* A Scenario will pop up, maybe asking if they have an item, or gives them a chance to be explained something
* Certain Scenario's will stop the player from entering or fight based on whether they have an item or not
* The Story Array will also contain states which is the main function of the player's context, like whether they have an item or not. -->

## Future Plans for StoryQuest

* Multiple tracks of music for all the various areas.
* Icons and better visuals.
* Polishing all around and more!
